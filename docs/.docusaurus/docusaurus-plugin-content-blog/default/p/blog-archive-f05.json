Framv teaches us *locality*. By scoping state and logic strictly to the components that own them, we eliminate the need for complex global state management in 90% of applications.\n\n## Designed for Performance\n\n*   **Zero-Runtime Overhead**: Templates are compiled to raw DOM operations.\n*   **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Only the text node that changes gets updated. No tree diffing.\n*   **Universal Deployment**: Build once, deploy to edge, server, or static CDN.\n\nFramv is the foundation for the next generation of high-performance web applications."}]}}
